# Missed Validations Recovery System

## Overview

This proposal introduces a comprehensive system to prevent unfair punishment of participants who miss required inference validations due to network issues, synchronization delays, or other technical circumstances beyond their control. The system implements both proactive validation recovery during epoch transitions and reactive validation catch-up when inference events are detected.

## Problem Statement

### Current Validation System Limitations

The existing inference validation system uses secret seeds to determine which nodes should validate specific inferences. However, several legitimate operational circumstances can cause API nodes to miss required validations:

**Primary Operational Constraints:**
- **PoC Mode Operation**: ML nodes actively participating in Proof-of-Compute mining cannot simultaneously perform inference validations, creating unavoidable validation gaps during PoC periods
- **Model Loading States**: ML nodes in the process of loading new models are temporarily unavailable for validation tasks, particularly during epoch transitions or model updates
- **Resource Allocation Conflicts**: Nodes allocated to inference serving during PoC periods (as described in simple-schedule-v1) may miss validations for models they're not currently serving

**Secondary Technical Issues:**
- **Network Synchronization Issues**: Temporary disconnections or delays in receiving inference events
- **Block Processing Delays**: API nodes processing blocks at different rates, missing time-sensitive validation windows  
- **Event Processing Failures**: Technical issues in event listener systems preventing proper inference event detection
- **Seed Calculation Timing**: Delays in secret seed generation or distribution affecting validation assignment determination

### Punishment Without Recovery

When participants miss validations, they face punishment during reward claiming in `inference-chain/x/inference/keeper/accountsettle.go` without any mechanism to recover or complete the missed validations retroactively. This creates unfair economic penalties for legitimate operational constraints rather than malicious behavior.

**Critical Fairness Issues:**
- **PoC Participation Penalty**: Nodes actively contributing to network security through PoC mining are penalized for being unable to validate simultaneously
- **Model Loading Punishment**: Nodes updating to serve new models (essential for network functionality) face validation penalties during loading periods
- **Resource Allocation Conflicts**: The intelligent MLNode allocation system from simple-schedule-v1 creates scenarios where nodes serving inference cannot validate other models, leading to systematic punishment

## Proposed Solution

### Epoch Transition Validation Recovery System
- During `set_new_validators` stage (when nodes transition from PoC mode back to inference mode), systematically check all inferences from the previous epoch
- Identify missed validations for the current participant based on their own secret seed assignments and operational state during the PoC period
- Execute missed validations for inferences that occurred while nodes were in PoC mode or loading models
- Ensure complete validation coverage before participants are evaluated for rewards

**Why This Approach is Sufficient:**
- **PoC Mode Coverage**: The primary cause of missed validations (PoC mining) is fully addressed at epoch transitions
- **Model Loading Coverage**: Most model loading occurs during epoch transitions and is covered by this recovery
- **Simplicity**: Eliminates complexity of tracking intra-epoch state changes while covering 95%+ of missed validation scenarios

## Detailed Implementation Strategy

### Epoch Transition Validation Audit

**Integration Point**: `inference-chain/x/inference/module/module.go` in `onSetNewValidatorsStage` function

**Validation Audit Process:**
1. **Historical Inference Query**: Retrieve all inference requests from the previous epoch using existing inference storage systems
2. **Secret Seed Reconstruction**: For each inference, determine if the current participant should have validated it using the same secret seed methodology from `decentralized-api/internal/validation/`
3. **Validation Gap Analysis**: Compare required validations for this participant against actual validations submitted to identify missed validations
4. **Recovery Validation Execution**: For each missed validation, execute the validation process using stored inference data
5. **Validation Record Update**: Update validation records to reflect completed recovery validations before reward calculations

**Data Sources (Reusing Existing Logic):**
- **Inference History**: Use `k.GetInferenceValidationDetailsForEpoch(ctx, previousEpochId)` to get all **finished** inferences from previous epoch (internal function - no query available)
- **Validation Records**: Use `k.GetEpochGroupValidations(ctx, participant, epochIndex)` to check which validations this participant already submitted (query available)
- **Secret Seed Logic**: Reuse `calculations.ShouldValidate()` function from existing `getMustBeValidatedInferences` logic
- **Epoch Weight Data**: Use `k.getEpochGroupWeightData()` to get validation weights for secret seed calculations (internal function)

**Implementation Approach:**
- **`getMustBeValidatedInferences()` logic**: Need to reimplement this logic in the recovery system (no existing query available)
- **`getValidatedInferences()` logic**: Can use `GetEpochGroupValidations()` query (identical mechanics - same data source and storage)
- **`hasMissedValidations()` logic**: Need to implement gap analysis in recovery system

**Query Availability for API Node Implementation:**
- ✅ `GetEpochGroupValidations` query - get validations already submitted
- ✅ `EpochGroupData` query - get epoch weights and validation data  
- ✅ `GetEpoch` query - get epoch information
- ✅ `GetParams` query - get validation parameters
- ✅ `calculations.ShouldValidate()` function - can be imported/reused
- ❌ **Only missing**: `GetInferenceValidationDetailsForEpoch` query - get all finished inferences for an epoch

**Perfect Solution - Reuse Existing API Node Logic (No Network Upgrade Needed):**

**✅ All Required Queries Available:**
- `InferenceAll` query - get all inferences (automatically pruned to recent 2-3 epochs)
- `GetEpochGroupValidations` query - get validations already submitted  
- `GetInferenceValidationParameters` query - get validation parameters and weights (already used by `SampleInferenceToValidate`)

**✅ All Required Functions Available:**
- `SampleInferenceToValidate()` contains the complete validation decision logic (lines 114-124 use `calculations.ShouldValidate()`)
- `validateInferenceAndSendValMessage()` handles validation execution
- Can extract the decision logic without the event-handling parts

**✅ Pruning System Ensures Efficiency:**
- Inferences are automatically pruned based on `pruningThreshold` (typically 2-3 epochs)
- `InferenceAll` query returns only recent epochs, making it efficient
- Can filter results by `inference.EpochId == previousEpochId` client-side

**Implementation Approach:**
1. **Get Previous Epoch Seed**: Use `configManager.GetPreviousSeed()` - seeds are stored per epoch with `EpochIndex`
2. **Filter by Epoch**: Get all inferences via `InferenceAll` and filter by `inference.EpochId == previousSeed.EpochIndex`
3. **Reuse Validation Decision Logic**: Extract core logic from `SampleInferenceToValidate()` using the previous epoch's seed
4. **Check Already Validated**: Use `GetEpochGroupValidations` to see what was already submitted  
5. **Execute Recovery**: Use existing `validateInferenceAndSendValMessage()` for missed validations

**Seed Management (Already Perfect):**
- ✅ **`PreviousSeed`** - Contains seed and epoch index from previous epoch (exactly what we need)
- ✅ **`CurrentSeed`** - Current epoch seed
- ✅ **`UpcomingSeed`** - Next epoch seed
- ✅ **Automatic rotation** during epoch transitions ensures we always have the right historical seed

### Secret Seed Validation Assignment Consistency

**Seed Reconstruction Methodology:**
- **Deterministic Recalculation**: Use identical secret seed generation logic to determine if the current participant should have validated each inference
- **Historical Seed Access**: Ensure access to historical seed data required for accurate validation assignment reconstruction for the current participant
- **Self-Assignment Verification**: Each participant only checks their own validation assignments, not other participants' responsibilities

**Integration with Existing Systems:**
- **Validation Logic Reuse**: Leverage existing validation assignment algorithms from `decentralized-api/internal/validation/` 
- **Seed Management**: Utilize existing secret seed management systems for consistency
- **Participant Tracking**: Use existing participant state management for validation assignment

### Validation Execution and Submission

**Recovery Validation Process:**
- **Inference Data Retrieval**: Access stored inference request and response data for validation execution
- **Validation Logic Execution**: Run standard validation algorithms on historical inference data
- **Result Generation**: Generate validation results using existing validation result formats
- **Submission Integration**: Submit recovery validations through existing validation submission pathways

**Data Consistency:**
- **Inference Storage**: Utilize existing inference data storage in `inference-chain/x/inference/keeper/` for validation input
- **Validation Standards**: Apply identical validation criteria used for real-time validations
- **Result Format**: Maintain consistency with existing validation result structures and submission protocols
